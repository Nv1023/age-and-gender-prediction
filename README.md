# 🦺 NPPE Detection using Deep Learning & Generative AI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Kaggle competition: SEP-25 DL GenAI NPPE-1**.  
The objective is to build a **deep learning–based computer vision system** that can detect and classify the presence or absence of **Non-Personal Protective Equipment (NPPE)** from visual data.

Such systems are critical in **industrial safety, construction monitoring, and workplace compliance**, where automated inspection can significantly reduce risks and improve safety standards.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze image-based data provided in the competition
- Train deep learning models to identify NPPE patterns
- Predict labels accurately for unseen test samples
- Generate submissions compatible with Kaggle evaluation
